#Doctors Visit Analysis
  The Doctors Visit Analysis project is a data analytics initiative aimed at understanding patterns in healthcare visits, illness frequency, and insurance coverage. The project focuses on analyzing patient demographics, health outcomes, and socioeconomic factors that influence healthcare utilization.

#Key objectives include:
  Counting the total number of people based on illness frequency.
  Analyzing gender-wise illness trends and activity reduction due to illness.
  Visualizing missing data using heatmaps.
  Studying correlations between dataset variables.
  Investigating the impact of income on hospital visits.
  Analyzing insurance coverage trends (government vs. private).
  Providing actionable insights for healthcare providers, policymakers, researchers, and insurers.

#Technology Stack
  Programming Language: Python 3.11.1

#Results
Correlation Between Variables:

    The analysis identified strong correlations between variables, helping to pinpoint key factors influencing healthcare visits, such as income, health insurance coverage, and gender.
    Gender-Based Illness Analysis:
    
    Visualized the frequency of illness among males and females, revealing patterns such as higher illness rates in specific demographics.
    Activity Reduction Due to Illness:
    
    Generated bar charts showing the number of days of reduced activity for males and females separately due to illness.
    Handling Missing Data:
    
    Utilized heatmaps to detect and manage missing data effectively, ensuring the reliability of results.
    Income's Impact on Hospital Visits:
    
    Found that individuals with lower income levels had higher hospital visit frequencies. This suggests a direct relationship between socioeconomic factors and healthcare utilization.
    Health Insurance Coverage:
    
    Government Health Insurance: A higher percentage of low-income or elderly individuals benefited from government health insurance.
    Private Health Insurance: Calculated and visualized the proportion of people covered by private insurance compared to government insurance.
    Relation Between Health Status and Activity Reduction:
    
    Heatmaps revealed clear patterns linking poor health status to extended activity reduction days.
    Illness Count by Demographics:
    
    The dataset was analyzed to count illness occurrences across different age groups, genders, and income brackets.
    Duplicate Entry Detection:
    
    Identified and removed duplicate data entries to improve data quality.
    Visualization of Key Trends:
    
    Created detailed visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps) to simplify complex data and highlight meaningful patterns.
